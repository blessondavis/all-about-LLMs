Collection of some great projects using Foundational Models (FMs)
Generative AI has a variety of applications in different fields (content creation being one of the promising use cases). I have some notebooks that have been tested out personally or produced by the open-source community. 

## 1. Implementing RAG using LlamaIndex and Zephyr Model
This notebook was run on Google Colab and there are multiple ways to improve the model for better performance. However, this notebook helps you to get started with Llamaindex and open-source models like Zephyr 7B.

## 2. Exploring Gemini by Google
This notebook features different capabilities of Gemini Model that was released by Google towards the end of 2023. To use this notebook, you need to create a developer access keys from MakerSuite (https://makersuite.google.com/). Gemini Vision Pro accepts image as input as well which can be leveraged to extract information from documents and many such application where information needs to be extracted from images.

## 3. Building with Gemini and Llamaindex
This notebook features different ways to use the multimodal capabilities of Gemini model to create exciting applications. Pydantic library can be used to create structured output that can be useful integrating the LLM with existing application. The notebook also briefly discusses how to build an RAG solution that is based not only on text but image data.
